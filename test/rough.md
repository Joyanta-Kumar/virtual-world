It could make me more confident if I already knew how many unique edges are possible with the nodes I have.

| nodes | edges |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     |
| 2     | 1     |
| 3     | 3     |
| 4     | 6     |
| 5     | 10    |

So the number of edge is (n-1) + (n-2) + .. + 0  
here, n is number of nodes.
